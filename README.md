## Simulating Agents in ChatGPT 
Prompt:

I'd like to simulate an AI agent that I'm designing. The agent will be built using the GAME framework with these components:

Goals: Document all of the code in the project
Actions:
- get_project_directory()
- list_files(fully_qualified_path)
- read_file(fully_qualified_path)
- write_file(fully_qualified_path, string_contents)

At each step, your output must be an action to take.

Stop and wait and I will type in the result of the action as my next message.

Ask me for the first task to perform.
